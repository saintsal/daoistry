## Generative Artistry

[Generative Artistry](https://generativeartistry.com) is a **work in progress** blog & tutorial website exploring generative art with self-coding examples. 

### Tutorial Markdown

The version of tutorial markdown in this demo is super conceptual, and is currently being completely rewritten, so please take it with a grain of salt, and bare with me for a month or so. Or reach out if you want to help!

### Setup
Generative Artistry runs on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). To set it up locally you will need to:
1. `git clone git@github.com:tholman/generative-artistry.git`
1. `brew install hugo` ([or install via other means](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/))
1. `hugo server`
