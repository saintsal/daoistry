title: The Vetocratic vs Actiocratic Axis
---


Vitalik Buterin (founder of Ethereum) [explains how we can think of this as an axis](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/19/bullveto.html):

**Vetocratic** - the power to those who restrict

> Doing anything potentially disruptive and controversial requires getting a sign-off from a large number of different and diverse actors, any of whom could stop it

**Actiocratic** - power to those taking action  (which Buterin calls Bulldozers)

> Single actors can do important and meaningful, but potentially risky and disruptive, things without asking for permission

There's a balance in DAOs, and many of the opportunities and challenges in DAOs stem from Vetocracies that should be Actiocracies, and vice versa.

Vetocracies are generally used when slow but stead progress is needed, for example to defend common goods or maintain responsibilities.

Actiocracies are generally used to enable exploration, experimentation, create new value or respond quickly.

When challenging the status quo, Actiocracies are needed to promote the new paradigms.Once the status quo is changed, Vetocracies are needed to protect what they created.  

Most (web2) online communities stayed Actiocracies for too long, allowing the change-makers to dominate people and erode the common goods they created. 

But on the flip side, most large DAOs end up with stagnating with too much vetocracy.  When whales accumulate tokens and act as "governance" but are detached from the actual work, they end up blocking useful work because they don't understand it. When projects teams become too focused on coordinating with treasuries, they end up constraining their own direction based on the opinion of the vetocracy.  This leads to talented people leaving the DAO, and difficulty for new people to see how they can plug in usefully.
