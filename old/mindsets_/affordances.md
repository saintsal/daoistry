not ownership
not fixed amounts of tokens either

they go up and down in price like stocks.
but stocks are ownership (old paradigm)

what is being traded?
projected future value

stocks - what the market believes is the value of that company, considering not just its assets but it's potential

tokens - what the market believes is the value of the coordination system that that token provides to its community, and what's the potential of that

what does tokenised coordination look like?

affordances 

how people interact with digital objects, like apps

but how apps coordinate capital and people

like airnbnb

it works because people understand that object in a common way


tokenomics allow us to create other coordiation systems, this time ones that are tradable

tradable coordination systems

how well does that work? what value will that bring in the future?


people align to a nother star without being an
owner, shareholder, employee

this gives rise to a set of behaviours:
- if you believe in it enough to participate, buy in
- if you believe it will increaes in potential, you stake in (where you can't sell for a set period, and gain more)
- if you don't believe in it, you sell
