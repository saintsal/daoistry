title: Update calls
---

Update calls feel easy, but they make too many things hard.

Update calls lock out everyone who wasn't in the call. This creates a shadow hierarchy, since update information is only shared with people on the call. When update calls become the norm, self-coordination becomes a real pain, because everyone needs to be on so many calls!

The way out is to update asynchronously.
