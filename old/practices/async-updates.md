# Async the updates

New people join a DAO, and have no idea where to go. Guilds can't keep all their members up to speed, let alone other guilds.

Why? Because all the important info is shared in 
in ephemerical channels: voice chats, group calls,  dms and endlessly scrolling channels. No way to keep up.

The fix isn't onboarding or more meetings, its when the core team members of projects communicate heir progress *to each other* in an async feed.

Usually this is a few bullet points on a dedicated forum category, or low-frequency chat channel where only [core team](/core-team) members can post. The key is to use only one **[single source of truth](/ssot)** to get caught up. 

*Note: Async means all parties can communicate at different times. Taking a conversation off group chat and into a one-on-one call isn't async, it's just 2 people in sync. Async is when everyone can participate in the communication at a different time.*

## Related practices
Every sync up or [priority-setting meeting](/squad-priorities), disallow updates on the call.  Instead, expect everyone to have written an update in the updates feed, and everyone to have caught up there.
