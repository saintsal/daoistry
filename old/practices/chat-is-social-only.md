title: Chat is not a feed.

The worst thing in the universe is having to follow yet another chatroom. DAO chatrrooms are usually really busy, but when you look at who's getting the real work done, they're not on chat. They've say so "no" to FOMO.

Chat is strictly for social, fun and random stuff only. So its optional and you can tune out without worry.
