Seems okay, except for 2 big problems:

1. It causes delays to get things done, especially quick and important stuff.
2. It prevents emotional issues from being talked about open.
3. And we all know this - the right people almost never show up to those group calls, so these issues drag on for weeks

For some reason, DAOs have too many group calls, so everyone tries to add more to the existing meetings rather than create new ones.

Since group calls suck, why not minimize them instead?

If something is really worth talking about, a 10-minute one on one call will usually work wonders.

If it's not, better to just say so up-front and save people the trouble.

If it needs feedback, write it up in a few paragraphs or record a 2-3 minute video so people can watch soon and respond.
