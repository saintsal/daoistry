title: Squad Independence 
---
[Squads](/squads) take responsibility for their results and direction, and report that to everyone else. They consult with the broader collective in order to set goals (Their Why) but have both full autonomy and responsibility for figuring out how to achieve them (Their How).

Squads choose their own tools, and set their own practices.  They do not have practices imposed on them by corporate higher-ups.

## Tips
A good way for squads to do this is using OKRs ([Objectives Key Results](https://www.dbooks.org/introduction-to-okrs-1491960272/)) but any form objectively observable/measurable goal works.

Squads set their own goals but these are usually related to goals set by other squads, so pay attention to what others are doing too. 

DAOs are not big ships, but an armada of tiny speedbaots, and sharing goals help see where everyone else is going.
