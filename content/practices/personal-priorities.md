title: Share your personal priorities
---

Every few weeks, write a quick note to update everyone with your top 3 priorities.  

This way, everyone knows whatâ€™s going on and and if they should connect with you about something (or not). It also creates a sense of peer accountability and peer support.

This one act is a game-changer for self-organising, because it let's anyone who can help you find you and connect.

## Tips 
- Try to describe your priorities as outcome states (*The website is drafted so the team can review it*( and not just a task ( *write website* ). 
- Ask for help if you might need it, especially if you need a specific skill.  Often just putting it out there helps attract the right person, but also feel free to tag specific people.
