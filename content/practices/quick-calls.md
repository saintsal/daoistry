title: Quick calls only 
---

We all know calls are useful, but all these scheduled group calls are horrible. So start with the obvious answer!

Quick calls only - one-on-one and unscheduled.

Calls should be used sparingly, since [async is more thoughtful and inclusive](/async-updates), but sometimes a voice conversation is the right way to go. 

Things like brainstorms, quick clarifications, or discussions that involve a lot of Q&A back-and-forth - and anything that gets a little emotional – it’s time for a call.

After the call, write a quick note on an async feed or the forum, so everyone’s in the loop.
