title: Squad priorities meeting
---

A great way to get rid of almost all group meetings is the squad priorities meeting

This is a structured meeting that happens at the same time each week. No updates or “while I’ve got you” stuff, since those happened already on [in async](). 

In a priorties meeting, there's only one thing to do: agree on the team's priorities for the coming week.  

The team works from a single kanban board, where each card is an outcome (not a task). 

1. Everyone says how much time they have in the coming week. (1 min)
2. The Decider (usually the proposer of the project, or someone with product experience) reorders the outcome cards. (1 min)
3. Card by card, whoever is working on that outcome estimates how hard it will be, using t-shirt sizes: S, M, L, XL.  (If there is disagreement, those people quickly share their reasons to see if someone missed something, and come to an agreement.) (15 mins)
4. The Decider then reorders the cards based on the estimates. (1 min)
5. People confirm their assignment to each card. (2 mins)

The meeting is over. Everyone hangs up to avoid [waiting for catch-alls](/no-catchall-meetings)

Now, the team has a shared list of priorities, and each person works on their highest-priority cards first.
