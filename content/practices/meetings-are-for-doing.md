title: Meetings are for doing, not updating
---

If you use meetings to update each other, you exclude people, isolate your team from the DAO, and waste everyone's time.

Updates are much better made on a dedicated, async feed, so you can update in real-time, and people can catch up on their own schedule.

When you get together, it should be to produce a result that is better done with real-time collaboration.

That could be agreeing on priorities (such as a 
20-minute [agile standup](/agile-standup) call) or working on a [boundary object](/boundary-objects) that gets everyone on the same page.
