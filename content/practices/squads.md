title: Small squads self-direct better
---

Squads form around projects (with one-time end results) or factories (to produce a similar output repeatedly) Squads are a maximum of 4 people to stay agile. 

Think of squads like a motorboat towing water-skiiers.

The people on the boat need to make quick decisions.  They should be committed, and experienced enough to make expert decisions. They drive.

Everyone else is a water skiier. They follow along and get pulled in when needed.

If a squad needs to be bigger than 4 people, we instead designate 2-3 people as squad members and the rest as water-skiiers. This avoids consensus decisions that just slow things down.

Squad members pick their own tools. The organisation doesn’t force tools on them, but also nobody outside of the squad is expected to use the tools the squad uses.

Each squad member holds themselves accountable. The best thing about no manager is also the worst – there’s nobody there the chase you.
