> The opposite of heirarchy isn't flatness, it's autonomy.

To understand decentralisation, you need to separate the [types of decentralisation](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274):


**Political Decentralisation** is when no single group can enforce their decisions on others. It increases autonomy and removes constraints.  It allows for people to control their own environment and do their best work.

Political centralisation means people have to work according to the rules others set.  Political decentralisation is when they set their own rules.

If there are people in your DAO who don't feel they can plug in, or feel their work and progress is constrained by others in the DAO, then your DAO probably suffers from political centralisation.


Ask:
> Does anyone make decisions that affect others autonomy?


## Examples
Corporations are politically centralised. The CEO calls the shots.  Departments also centralise various decisions that the rest of the company must obey.

Some chapter-based organisations are more decentralised. Each chapter calls its own shots, and if there is a head office, it's usually providing support and guidance, not enforcing rules.

Fractal organisations are fully decentralised.  They duplicate themselves without any dependence or communication on an external authority. MolochDAO is an example. If the people in a MolochDAO disagree on a proposal, the DAO splits into two DAOs, one with the yeses, and one with the noes. Both DAOs continue as normal.

## Domino effects
Political decentralisation differs from architectural decentralisation which is about resiliency and availability of infrastructure, and from logical decentralisation which is about shared state or meaning.

But they depend on each other.

If you have logical centralisation, where certain information or resources are kept in one place (ahem, treasury guilds and departmental guilds) then you also end up with political centralisation too, because those guilds make policy decisions that affect everyone else. (That's when your DAO starts to smell corporate.)

If you have any kind of political centralisation, for example creating functional departments, then that forces everyone back to depending on one way of doing something (logical centralisation) and that usually leads to accessing that department and its resources in one place (architectural centralisation).

## How to politically decentralise
To move towards political decentralisation, ask:
- Are we forcing anyone to behave based on policy we're setting?  
- Can we instead let them work their way, and provide them support and access when requested?

**Architectural Decentralisation** is 

about creating redundancies make infrastructure resilient. 

How many physical computers is a system made up of? How resilient is the system to those computers breaking down?

| Centralised | Decentralised |
| - | - |
| Facebook | The Internet |

**Logical Decentralisation** â€” is the system a swarm that can be divided in any way and have both separate parts still function? Does it create any shared resources that all participants depend on?

## Examples
The Internet's base layer (TCP/IP) is architecturally decentralised. Any number of routers can go down, but the Internet stays connected to itself.

Facebook and Twitter are architecturally decentralised. When their servers go down, nobody can connect.



Bittorrent swarms are logically decentralised.  You could cut off all of Africa's and all of Asia's bittorrents, and both would continue on by themselves.

Languages are logically decentralized. The English spoken between Alice and Bob and the English spoken between Charlie and David do not need to agree at all. There is no centralized infrastructure required for a language to exist, and the rules of English grammar are not created or controlled by any one single person.

Here's the thing. These are all related.

If you have architectural centralisation, even if it's just for something like a chat server (ahem, Discord) then only certain people can manage that chat server.  That's now political centralisation too.

If you have logical centralisation, where certain information or resources are kept in one place (ahem, treasury guilds) then you also end up with political centralisation.

Political centralisation means other people have to work according to the rules others set.  It might not look like a standard company hierarchy, because there's no org chart, but it's still a shadow hierarchy.

If you have any kind of political centralisation, for example creating departments, then that forces everyone back to depending on resources (logical centralisation) and that means storing them all in one place (architectural centralisation.)

So any form of centralisation leads to more centralisation, which is the opposite of what DAOs stand for!

The decentralised mindset asks:

- Are we hoarding or centralising any resources here?  Can we instead distribute them?  Instead of Google Drive, can we share data on IPFS or Filecoin? Instead of functional departments, can we distribute the needed people directly onto small inter-disciplinary project squads?


- Are creating any centralised infrastructure, like bots or Notion accounts?  Instead, can we assist teams to create their own?
