title: Remove the middle man(agement)
---

A big idea in DAOs is to get rid of the middle man.

But middlemen are also management.

If you control the money, or control the information, you've made yourself a middleman.

Most middlemen in DAOs got there by accident.

They made a proposal and ended up managing the token allocation.  They joined a guild and ended up making all the important decisions and updates in meetings. 

Next thing you know, that DAO feels a whole lot like a bad company.

DAOS rely on tokenisation as a way for people to truly take ownership.

The idea is that people can buy in, and just get to work with whatever they see needs doing, and the value of the organisation increases for everyone.

So why doesn't this really happen?

Well, the incentives skew to early buyers becoming middle managers.  As they buy in, they drive the price up, making the relative share of later buyers much lower.

Those new helpers come in, and see the way to earn a meaningful piece of the pie is to work for an existing shareholder, someone who probably got a proposal approved and now decides what to do with a token allocation they didn't buy themselves.

This quickly starts to look like corporate middle management, where there are layers of people holding the chips and passing down a few to the people actually doing the work.
