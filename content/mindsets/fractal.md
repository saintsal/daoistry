title: Think Fractal
---

When a bunch of cells make an animal, that's fractals. When a bunch of buildings make a village, that's fractals. And when a bunch of people make an organisation... 

... that depends on the organisation.

There are plenty of examples for decentalised organisations that DAOs can draw from:
- chapter-based organisations, like the Kiwanis Club, Freemasons and Hell's Angels
- meetup groups that sprout up in different cities
- open source projects that [come together to build something](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar)
- companies that have decentralised themselves, like [Semco](https://1lib.domains/?redirectUrl=/book/3589922/ba493e), [Valve Games](https://archive.org/details/ValveEmployeeHandbook), Goretex and Spotify
- startups that have created best practices for [small, remote teams](https://1lib.domains/?redirectUrl=/book/2204075/1009af)

They all have something in common: they rely on individuals to make the changes to decentralisation.

**Meaning the next step to decentralisation happens with you.**


If you're trying to make an organisation decentralised by starting at the top, you're depending on hierarchy. 

Decentralisation is about autonomy and mutual dependence.  It starts with individuals and small teams, then it spreads. 

If you're trying to do anything organisation-wide, you're also creating centralisation. 

Decentralisation is fractal.  A decentralised organisation will take shape based on what the smaller parts do. The parts form the whole, the whole doesn't control the parts.

So the way forward for you is simple: start acting like a decentralised fractal, and help those around you too.

It's usually just a matter of changing the right work habits.

> That's what this site is for.  Pick a few habits that make sense to you, and share the those habits with the people you work with, and start.
