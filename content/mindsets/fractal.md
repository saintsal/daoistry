Decentralisation is fractal.  A decentralised organisation will take shape based on what the smaller parts do. The parts form the whole, the whole doesn't control the parts.

MolochDAO is one of the most prolific fractal DAOs.  It's designed to stay small, and split if needed.       As MolochDAO got more popular, it didn't grow, it enabled hundreds more MolochDAOs to start, and you might have heard of some like DAOHaus and MetaCartel.

Even the larger DAOs are fractalising from within.  MakerDAO, Yearn, Synthetix have all seen Working Groups emerge.  And a number of DAOs are now generating SubDAOs to manage specific resources.  The underlying reason is the same: smaller groups coordinate better and get results.

These fractals go by different names. Squads, working groups, subDAOs, teams... but the underlying approach is the similar: 
- They take responsibility for their results and direction, and report that to everyone else. They don't report to any centralised body (including treasuries or governors) but instead consult with the broader collective.
- They have a mandate dictated by the larger DAO (Their Why) but have both full autonomy and responsibility for figuring out how to achieve them (Their How).
- They choose their own tools, and set their own practices.  They do not have practices or tools imposed on them by others.
- They are functionally complete and internally resourced.  (In other words, they are [architecturally decentralised](/mindsets/decentarlisation/).) They don't need to work within a complicated DAO framework to get paid and all the skills they need are either on their team or within arms reach.


## The handshake rule
Why is this shift happening?

Self-coordination works, but only in smaller groups. Coordinating large groups ends up with centralised management.  

There's a mathematical phenomenon behind this.  Consider how many handshakes are for a group of a given size to all be in agreement.

One person?  Zero handshakes! They already agree with themselves.

Two people?  One handshake.  Three people? Three handshakes.  Four people? Six handshakes.  Five people? Ten handshakes. Ten people? 45 handshakes!

Now, consider that when people disagree, they don't normally say. They might try to be agreeable but end up prioritising things differently. They might not be able to communicate so not find the way to agree.  They might just get caught up and miss a call. In all of these cases, we have a handshake fail, and if that's something the team depends on, it ripples out to create a bigger failure.   Usually these don't look like failures, but just delays.

Back to the math, let's say that each handshake has a 90% likelihood of success, so a 10% liklihood of failure.

Two people have a 90% chance of success. Three have an 81% chance (0.9 ^ 2).  Four people have a 72% chance (0.9 ^ 3) which is already a 28% chance of failure!  Ten people only have a 34% chance of success!

When DAOs try to coordinate large project groups, especially groups where people can come and go every week, they have too many people to coordinate.

## What to do about it
So the way forward for you is simple: start acting like a decentralised fractal. Pick a small group to work with, commit to a result with them, and coordinate only with them.

This form of working will help your DAO progress towards decentralisation and autonomy.

Making this switch seems hard, but it's usually just a matter of realising that you don't need to rely on anything Centralised in a DAO, and changing the right work habits.

> By the way, this site is designed for to help you fractalise  Pick a few habits that make sense to you, and share the those habits with the people you work with, then start.

When a bunch of cells make an animal, that's fractals. When a bunch of buildings make a village, that's fractals. And when a bunch of people make an organisation... 

... that depends on the organisation.

There are plenty of examples for decentalised organisations that DAOs can draw from:
- chapter-based organisations, like the Kiwanis Club, Freemasons and Hell's Angels
- meetup groups that sprout up in different cities
- open source projects that [come together to build something](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar)
- companies that have decentralised themselves, like [Semco](https://1lib.domains/?redirectUrl=/book/3589922/ba493e), [Valve Games](https://archive.org/details/ValveEmployeeHandbook), Goretex and Spotify
- startups that have created best practices for [small, remote teams](https://1lib.domains/?redirectUrl=/book/2204075/1009af)

They all have something in common: they rely on individuals to make the changes to decentralisation.

**Meaning the next step to decentralisation happens with you.**


If you're trying to make an organisation decentralised by starting at the top, you're depending on hierarchy. 

Decentralisation is about autonomy and mutual dependence.  It starts with individuals and small teams, then it spreads. 

If you're trying to do anything organisation-wide, you're also creating centralisation.
