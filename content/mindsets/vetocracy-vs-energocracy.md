title: Vetocratic vs Actiocratic
---

DAOs are a new form of human coordination, but not because they're decentralised, or because they're open. (Those have happened before. DAOS are a new form of human coordination because they [align people using blockchains](http://mediatheoryjournal.org/laura-lotti-blockchain-affordances/).

DAOS have explicitly-coded forms of ownership and participation on blockchains, allowing people to self-coordinate around a common goal.

This creates a new kind of interdependence between members which we're still learning about and evolving.

Vitalik Buterin (founder of Ethereum) [explains how we can think of this as an axis](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/19/bullveto.html):

**Vetocratic** - the power to those who restrict
> Doing anything potentially disruptive and controversial requires getting a sign-off from a large number of different and diverse actors, any of whom could stop it

**Actiocratic** - power to those taking action  (which Buterin calls Bulldozers)
> single actors can do important and meaningful, but potentially risky and disruptive, things without asking for permission



There's a balance in DAOs, and many of the opportunities and challenges in DAOs stem from Vetocracies that should be Actiocracies, and vice versa.

- When challenging the status quo, Actiocracies are needed to promote the new paradigms.
- Once the status quo is changed, Vetocracies are needed to protect the new paradigms. ( Most (web2) online communities stayed Actiocracies for too long, allowing the change-makers to dominate people and erode the common goods they created.)
- Blockchain base layers benefit from vetocracies, making sure changes are slow and sure-footed.
- Blockchain application layers benefit from actiocracies, enabling experimentation and agile leadership of new blockchain use cases.
