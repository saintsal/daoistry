title: The Three Types of Decentralisation

> The opposite of hierarchy isn't flatness, it's autonomy.

To understand decentralisation, you need to separate the [types of decentralisation](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274) which Vitalik Buterin (founder of Ethereum)  distinguishes as political, architectural and logical.


**Architectural Decentralisation** is about creating redundancies make infrastructure resilient. There is no central point in the architecture that the others depend on.  Blockchain technology is architecturally decentralised, in that blockchain users are not reliant on any specific group of miners.

**Logical Decentralisation** is about how the system acts.  There is no centralised information that the other parts rely on. Instead, data is shared in a swarm, and different parts of the system update each other to arrive at consistency. Logically decentralised systems acan be divided any way and both parts will continue to function independently.

**Political Decentralisation** is when no single group can enforce their decisions on others. It increases autonomy and removes constraints.  It allows for people to control their own environment and do their best work.

Political centralisation means people have to work according to the rules others set. This takes different forms: departments, policy makers,executive leadership setting goals for others.

Political decentralisation is when people set their own rules. This can also take different forms: chapter-based organisations, democratic cells, independent projects with common support such as startup accelerators.

## The 3 forms of decentralisation are connected 

While the three are connected, political decentralisation is particularly important to DAOs since its the lynchpin for the others.

Political decentralisation differs from architectural decentralisation which is about resiliency and availability of infrastructure, and from logical decentralisation which is about shared state or meaning.

But they depend on each other.

If you have logical centralisation, where certain information or resources are kept in one place (such as treasury guilds and departmental guilds) then you also end up with political centralisation too, because those guilds tend to make policy decisions that affect everyone else. (That's when people have to invest in politics and meetings rather than real work, and when non-corporate people say your DAO feels corporate.)

If you have any kind of political centralisation, for example creating functional departments, then that forces everyone back to depending on one way of doing something (logical centralisation). 

It also leads to storing resources in one place (architectural centralisation). For example, deciding that everyone in the DAO should use a certain tool (Discord, Notion, Sobol) turns the adminsistrators of those systems into political centers -- they now decide who gets access and how much.

## How to politically decentralise
If there are people in your DAO who don't feel they can plug in, or feel their work and progress is constrained by others in the DAO, then your DAO probably suffers from political centralisation.

> Does anyone make decisions that affect others autonomy?

- Instead of forcing others to behave based on a set policy, let them work their way
- Instead of creating and enforcing policy, achieve the same aims through support.
