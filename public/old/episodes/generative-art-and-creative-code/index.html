<p>I&rsquo;ve got some history stuff here. New tendencies exhibitions. So this is the first exhibitions that, this was the first series of exhibitions that brought computers or coding specifically into the art forms that they were displaying. They had a series of five exhibitions, new tendencies, and all the big art galleries around the world. It was the fourth exhibition that was actually called computer and visual research in 1968. There&rsquo;s a collective from the Netherlands compos 68, 1968 to 1969 they&rsquo;re formed. Jan Baptist Bedaux, Jerian Clausman, pretty sure I pronounced that right. And Arthur Bean, they were collective from the Netherlands that brought about some of the first digital art, which wasn&rsquo;t necessarily produced on a computer, but it was just by a computer. So they would create the algorithms for the computer and then sort of paint them.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s so cool, like looking at the big long kind of history of generative art and Computer Art. It&rsquo;s like as soon as there were computers, there were some people that were like, let&rsquo;s create art on these things. You know, let&rsquo;s, even that example that you use where they use the computers to generate it and then they would paint it. It&rsquo;s still, it&rsquo;s still like, yeah, the second that it exists, somebody is going to try and get creative with that technology, which I love.

<p>But yeah, I’ve spent a lot of time, I think when you play around with a pen plotter you immediately kind of dig back to the first, the first pieces of generative art where they&rsquo;re using, it&rsquo;s like, what are those vector display kind of, you know, what am I trying to talk about here? Like before you had a screen, you had the one that&rsquo;s like the little laser on it, like the old video games.

<p>I think like when you have like, it&rsquo;s funny that you brought up the mathematicians, when you&rsquo;re playing around with like particular algorithms and particular ways to do things. And you  want to represent that on a piece of paper or on a screen, its kind of intrinsically ends up looking very artistic to me. You know, if you, if you pick something like an algorithm to pack as many circles as you want onto a page. And they have to be random sizes. You know, it ends up kind of creating like a molecular kind of cell.

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a good one for you, you know this. Cause we have been actually spoken about this before. I read about this the other day. I was actually, I was doing some research on, I was writing a new talk and I do a lot of audio visualizations. So I was looking at like the history of that. There is a guy called Thomas Wilfred in the 1920s. He actually created an instrument called the Clabalax. He called it a Clabalax. Basically what he did was he stringed up a keyboard, not like a laptop keyboard. We don&rsquo;t have them in the 1920s, like an actual sort of organ-based keyboard, but he strung it up with gels. So his gels specifically, we didn&rsquo;t have like gels as far as visual artists to concerned is. So if you imagine all projectors, used to have at school, used to have like light projectors where you put a piece of film on the base and it would project up from mirror and project from the wall. Gels were like two things together and you could put like liquid in the middle and you can move them around or like gels over lights. It just colored film that you put over lights. They were gels. His gels were the bottom jam jars which he had painted in different colors. So he&rsquo;d strung up what he called gels, bottoms are jam jars on different strings with the insides of sewing machines to control them.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s basically like shining lights through these gels and when he plays the keyboard, when he plays this organ and lights to move. So the lights turn on, the gels move, and he is basically one of the first visual artists, like one of the first DJs. And to me that&rsquo;s one of the first generative artists as well. And he did like a whole show. We are going to do a whole chat on this properly. He did a whole show. There&rsquo;s no music. Just in, I think it was in London just in a theater in London and the whole audience was just absolutely amazed. After that, that&rsquo;s when he started putting these lights to music. Yeah. It&rsquo;s not just about computers, but that is like an early form of computer If you think about it, you&rsquo;re pressing buttons and things are moving.

<p>I really love your little comment about, you can’t see anything, but you could build it. When you figure it out, you&rsquo;re satisfied. Oh yeah, I see what they&rsquo;ve done there. They&rsquo;ve done this and they&rsquo;ve done that. I&rsquo;m good.

<p>It&rsquo;s not particularly expressive. Whereas if I wanted to build something creatively, I&rsquo;m just like hey, I’ve got this weird I did to make it do something that you say. I just built emotive piano, so I want to play a piano and I want emojis to come out of that every single time I, hit a key I what to show an emoji. There&rsquo;s no functionality behind that. It&rsquo;s merely expressive.

<p>Like are we creating these things that we&rsquo;re making for the end results or for the actual creative process at this meetup that was at this week. Two people are sitting there just went both, they didn&rsquo;t even waiver, they didn&rsquo;t even think about it. They just went both. It&rsquo;s the process and it&rsquo;s the final piece.  So as far as creative coding goes, cause I&rsquo;m the same. I&rsquo;m just like, yeah, you&rsquo;re creating a piece with your idea and this whole thing behind the idea and the journey that&rsquo;s taken you to this idea. But your tool, your choice of what is making this idea becomes part of who you are. We could&rsquo;ve been painters, we could&rsquo;ve been sculptors, we could&rsquo;ve been textile artists, we could&rsquo;ve been any number of things. Creativity&rsquo;s always been there, but we chose code for a reason. That&rsquo;s because of that&rsquo;s who we are as part of our journey.
