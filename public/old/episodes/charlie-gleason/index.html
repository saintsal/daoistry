<p><strong>Ruth:</strong> Charlie How are you?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie:</strong> I&rsquo;m very well, how are you?</p>

<p>And I got some friends and I&rsquo;m sorry if they are listening because they did their best, but the end product like was not something that was gonna work. And then I realized, Oh my gosh, I spent this money and I had like literally no option now. And so I turned to my trustee computer and made a thing called tweet flight, which is a music video that pulls tweets in real time based on the lyrics, like a big Twitter karaoke. And then that went further than I ever thought anything I ever did would. And then from there I got really hooked on this idea of using computers as a middle ground for making art.

<p><strong>Tim:</strong> Action script two?</p>

<p><strong>Tim:</strong> We love ourselves an actionscript.</p>

<p><strong>Tim:</strong> Cool, sexy math podcasts.

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>thing. I think there&rsquo;s some incredible projects out there now that have definitely been better maintained. So, I don&rsquo;t, yeah, I&rsquo;d love to, I mean at the end I’ll probably recommend a bunch that you should check out as well, but I still think, I mean for me, I still use sandpit and I think it&rsquo;s cool. I would say that.

<p>&lt;span data-time=10:05&quot;&quot;&gt;
<strong>Charlie:</strong> Yeah. Basically, the parameters will get saved in the URL. So, whatever you define as being like, I want this value to be changeable between these, between these like let&rsquo;s say that your like line thickness on some kind of like incredible, stunning or inspiring life changing piece of generative art. You could say like, all right, between 1 and 10 is the values that this will accept. And then as you shift those around, that gets stored in the URL and it made it heaps easier. If we were having a conversation around something, you could just be like, cool. As long as you&rsquo;re running in the same version as me, like the underlying code, you&rsquo;re still going to need to ring. As long as you have the same version running, you can kind of see these things happening in real time, really quickly, which felt great for this kind of freelance project. And then when we realized how well that worked for this freelance project, we kind of rolled it into this, into this concept of a library.

<p><strong>Charlie:</strong> Yeah, yeah. Very slow.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p><strong>Charlie:</strong> I am really nerdy with that. I like, I always worry, yeah, it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m a as 75- year-old. I&rsquo;m conservative in the way that I write on the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Ruth:</strong> You probably have&hellip; All my comments just to myself, just being rude to myself.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Charlie:</strong> Yeah. Like I&rsquo;m been getting to that one.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And just about for myself. So, I&rsquo;m a child. Are you working on anything right now Charlie?
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Charlie:</strong> It is, yes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>ever again because everything good has been made. You know, that feeling like if you, if you see like a really good project and you&rsquo;re like, well, I&rsquo;m done now.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Charlie:</strong> Don’t hang out with talented people.</p>
<p><strong>Ruth:</strong> I&rsquo;m just like, what am I actually doing?
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Ruth:</strong> Can I explain it? I am trying to explain it. It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s like a, it&rsquo;s a music video that you play in your browser that you can be a part of.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Right. It saves the photos as you go at the end you can publish them. That just gets sent out to everyone else. And it was using images API, which made it really easy cause it&rsquo;s all, there&rsquo;s no service side code on that. I think it&rsquo;s all open source as well. It is. Yeah. It&rsquo;s all in my GitHub. But yeah, it was an interesting mix of like trying to create after effects style masking and visuals in the browser in real time. And then also having this kind of element of playfulness of having other people around the world ideally being involved. I think my only issue with it is that five minutes is a long time, four minutes. Like it&rsquo;s a long time for a song. And I think a lot of the time on the web when you come across those kinds of things, you check them out and after 30 seconds you&rsquo;re like, Oh cool. And kind of the punchline of that music video doesn&rsquo;t really happen until you get to the end of the song. And so, I think my optimism that people would sit for like four minutes watching me tear myself apart on the screen was maybe overly optimistic. And if I did it again, I&rsquo;d definitely show that the photos are being taken or allow you to like upload the photos as you go. But it was like, it was a lot of fun and it was, it felt at the time, like I was really pushing what I was capable of doing, especially around web GL, Shaders.

<p><strong>Charlie:</strong> Ah, GLSL yeah, it&rsquo;s very unforgiving as well. It&rsquo;s only there&rsquo;s a console log in there either because it&rsquo;s run like directly on the GPU. Right? So, it&rsquo;s like&hellip;

<p><strong>Tim:</strong> Yeah. Should we wrap it up on that mystery, mystery of the day?
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Tim:</strong> Definitely. Definitely. I feel like I have, I actually already have questions that I’ll save for me.</p>
<p><strong>Ruth:</strong> Alright. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie:</strong> Well, thank you both. You&rsquo;re awesome.
