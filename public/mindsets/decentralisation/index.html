        <p>One of the big reasons DAOs are leading somewhere new is decentralisation.  But this term is often misunderstood.</p>
<p>Here we&rsquo;ll draw on <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">Vitalik Buterin&rsquo;s essay</a> (he&rsquo;s the founder of Ethereum) , where he clears things up.</p>
<p>Vitalik distinguishes 3 different types of decentralisation:</p>
<p><strong>Political</strong> - who makes the decisions that affect others autonomy?</p>
<p>Corporations are politically centralised. The CEO calls the shots.  Departments also centralise various decisions that the rest of the company must obey.</p>
<p>Chapter-based organisations are decentralised. The central organisation may give support and resources, but each chapter calls its own shots.</p>
<p>At the extreme, cell-based organisations duplicate themselves without any dependence or communication on a central authority. MolochDAO is an example.</p>
<p><strong>Architectural</strong> — how many physical computers is a system made up of? How resilient is the system to those computers breaking down?</p>
<p>The Internet&rsquo;s base layer (TCP/IP) is architecturally decentralised. Any number of routers can go down, but the Internet stays connected to itself.</p>
<p>Facebook and Twitter are architecturally decentralised. When their servers go down, nobody can connect.</p>
<p><strong>Logical</strong> — is the system a swarm that can be divided in any way and have both separate parts still function? Does it create any shared resources that all participants depend on?</p>
<p>Bittorrent swarms are logically decentralised.  You could cut off all of Africa&rsquo;s and all of Asia&rsquo;s bittorrents, and both would continue on by themselves.</p>
<p>Languages are logically decentralized. The English spoken between Alice and Bob and the English spoken between Charlie and David do not need to agree at all. There is no centralized infrastructure required for a language to exist, and the rules of English grammar are not created or controlled by any one single person.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing. These are all related.</p>
<p>If you have architectural centralisation, even if it&rsquo;s just for something like a chat server (ahem, Discord) then only certain people can manage that chat server.  That&rsquo;s now political centralisation too.</p>
<p>If you have logical centralisation, where certain information or resources are kept in one place (ahem, treasury guilds) then you also end up with political centralisation.</p>
<p>Political centralisation means other people have to work according to the rules others set.  It might not look like a standard company hierarchy, because there&rsquo;s no org chart, but it&rsquo;s still a shadow hierarchy.</p>
<p>If you have any kind of political centralisation, for example creating departments, then that forces everyone back to depending on resources (logical centralisation) and that means storing them all in one place (architectural centralisation.)</p>
<p>So any form of centralisation leads to more centralisation, which is the opposite of what DAOs stand for!</p>
<hr>
<p>The decentralised mindset asks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are we hoarding or centralising any resources here?  Can we instead distribute them?  Instead of Google Drive, can we share data on IPFS or Filecoin? Instead of functional departments, can we distribute the needed people directly onto small inter-disciplinary project squads?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are we forcing anyone to behave based on policy we&rsquo;re setting?  Can we instead let them work their way, and provide them support and access?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are creating any centralised infrastructure, like bots or Notion accounts?  Instead, can we assist teams to create their own?</p>
</li>
</ul>
